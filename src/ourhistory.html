                The concept for Ivybrook Academy was developed in 2005 by a first-grade teacher who recognized
                the absence of multidimensional learning opportunities for her students. Jennifer McWilliams knew
                they deserved better and was motivated to take action. She took her passion for shaping and
                teaching young minds and set out to create the optimal learning environment that recognized the
                strengths and needs of each child.

                The first Ivybrook Academy opened in Weddington, North Carolina, in August 2007 with nearly full
                enrollment on day one. Since then, our flagship campus has continually been voted the #1 Preschool
                in the Charlotte area. Shortly thereafter, seeing the students flourishing, Jennifer’s husband, Drew,
                realized that this concept can and should be brought to communities throughout the country. He
                left his real estate career to focus on bringing Ivybrook to new communities, and under the
                leadership of Jennifer and Drew, Ivybrook Academy opened its second campus in Fort Mill, SC, in
                2011. Once again, the Preschool was a success and became a beloved part of the community.

                Seeing how valuable the Ivybrook experience was for young children in these two communities,
                Jennifer and Drew knew they needed to bring their innovative Preschool to children across greater
                North Carolina and throughout the country. They meticulously developed a company growth plan
                that allowed them to expand the Ivybrook brand and provide students throughout the country with
                this invaluable opportunity. Today, Ivybrook Academy has over 20 campuses and is continuing to
                expand into new communities throughout the United States.
