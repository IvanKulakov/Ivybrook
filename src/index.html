                Bright futures begin with solid foundations. At Ivybrook Academy, we
                take an innovative approach to preschool that encourages critical
                thinking, highlights creativity, and fosters a love for learning. By
                recognizing the strengths and needs of each child, we allow their
                individual uniqueness to shine.

                The first Ivybrook Academy opened in Weddington, North Carolina, in August 2007 with nearly full
                enrollment on day one. Since then, our flagship campus has continually been voted the #1 Preschool
                in the Charlotte area. Shortly thereafter, seeing the students flourishing, Jennifer’s husband, Drew,
                realized that this concept can and should be brought to communities throughout the country. He
                left his real estate career to focus on bringing Ivybrook to new communities, and under the
                leadership of Jennifer and Drew, Ivybrook Academy opened its second campus in Fort Mill, SC, in
                2011. Once again, the Preschool was a success and became a beloved part of the community.
